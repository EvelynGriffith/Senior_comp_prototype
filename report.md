#### Part 1, Questions about the Design of the Prototype and Experiment

Please anticipate at least 500 words for this writing component.

 + Identify what research question (or central goal) related to your research project you will attempt to answer with an experiment.

    I want to know if I can create a text analysis code that will allow me to analyze the chatGPT stories from a single command. I would like to be able to have this show me interesting trends int the storytelling capabilities of ChatGPT. My next question is: What sorts of stories does ChatGPT produce and how can I alter them so that I have an interesting story that is completely different from the one that I originally received? Essentially the overarching question is how can I make chatGPT a better story teller?

+ What form of prototype are you going to use (Tool, software, website, etc.)? Describe this prototype's capabilities.

    I think I am going to make a tool that will allow me to analyze aspects of the text that ChatGPT produces and then elaborate on how that will be made more in-depth and interesting when I do my real comp. I will also explain that I will be able to use much more data during my real comp because I will have more time to collect the data. I will also express how I am hoping to automate the process in some way for my actual comp so that I spend less time collecting data than I will for the prototype section.

+ What will this prototype do? For instance, what inputs, output? Who are the users? Were will this prototype reside when it is being used?

    This prototype will take in text from the ChatGPT story and it will analyze its structure and textual intricacies. I would like it to analyze simple things for the prototype, just as a starting point. Things such as word count, which words were used the most, how many characters, things like that. This will then lead well into my experiment which I will explain next.

+ Identify what experimental findings will answer your research question. What data will your experiment produce?

    The experiment that I would like to do is based on altering the line that I feed into the ChatGPT bot. I would like to see how chatGPT responds (and more importantly how the trends respond) when I change different things in the sentence.

+ Outline the detailed steps of your experiment. To help visualize these steps create a technical diagram of your experimental steps (workflow of what you will do in your experiment).

    ![Flowchart](graphics/flowchart.png)
    
    In case the diagram image didn't show up, it is also in the graphics folder, so you can look at it there!

    - My first step is to collect data on a single line that I input into ChatGPT. 
    - next I will alter the line and see how the trends change
    - Then I will compare the data and detect differences between those two commands and suggest my theories for how that might mean that ChatGPT is going about story telling.
